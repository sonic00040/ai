# Project Progress Summary: Multi-Tenant AI Customer Response System

**Date:** August 27, 2025

---

## 1. Project Goal
To develop a multi-tenant AI customer response system, starting with a Telegram bot, capable of providing intelligent answers from company-specific knowledge bases.

---

## 2. Key Achievements & Resolved Issues

We have successfully addressed numerous challenges and brought the project to a near-complete state:

*   **Database Schema:** Corrected the `knowledge_bases` table's `embedding` column dimension from `VECTOR(768)` to `VECTOR(384)` to match the AI model.
*   **Company & Knowledge Base Upload:** Implemented and verified the `scripts/add_business.py` script to correctly add company information and knowledge base content to Supabase.
*   **Telegram Bot Token:** Resolved issues related to incorrect or revoked Telegram bot tokens. The bot can now successfully connect to Telegram.
*   **Telegram Chat ID:** Confirmed and verified the correct Telegram chat ID for the UrbanStep Footwear Ltd. channel. The bot can now send and receive messages from the channel.
*   **Python Module Imports:** Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` by ensuring the `PYTHONPATH` is correctly set when running the application.
*   **Uvicorn Restart Loop:** Addressed an issue where the Uvicorn server was getting stuck in a restart loop.
*   **Zombie Processes:** Identified and terminated rogue processes holding onto port `8000`, preventing the server from starting.
*   **Supabase Data Retrieval:** Fixed a bug in `rag_service.py` where embeddings retrieved from Supabase were being treated as strings instead of numerical arrays, causing a `ValueError` during semantic search.
*   **LLM Integration:** Successfully integrated the Google Gemini API into `rag_service.py` to generate intelligent responses.
*   **Environment Configuration:** Configured `backend/requirements.txt`, `backend/app/core/config.py`, and `backend/.env` to support the new Gemini API key.

## 3. Current Status & Problem

*   **Status:** The bot is running, successfully receiving messages, identifying the company, retrieving relevant knowledge from Supabase, and attempting to generate a response using the Gemini API.
*   **Problem:** The bot is currently replying with the message: **"I'm sorry, but I encountered an error while trying to generate a response."** This indicates that the call to the Gemini API is failing.

## 4. Last Debugging Attempt & Next Steps

*   **Last Attempt:** We were in the process of running the bot in the **foreground** to capture the exact error message from the Gemini API. This was interrupted by your request to save the progress.
*   **Hypothesis:** The error is likely related to Google Cloud project configuration (e.g., Generative Language API not fully enabled, or billing not linked to the project, even for free tier usage).
*   **Immediate Next Action:**
    1.  **Run the bot in the foreground.** This is crucial to see the specific error message from the Gemini API.
        ```bash
        PYTHONPATH=./backend backend/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
        ```
    2.  **Send a message to the bot in Telegram.**
    3.  **Report the exact error message** that appears in the console where the bot is running. This message will tell us precisely why the Gemini API call is failing.

## 5. Key Files Modified

*   `backend/requirements.txt`: Added `google-generativeai`.
*   `backend/app/core/config.py`: Added `GOOGLE_API_KEY` setting and removed `print(settings)`.
*   `backend/app/services/rag_service.py`: Implemented Gemini API call in `generate_response_with_llm` and fixed embedding parsing in `semantic_search`.
*   `backend/.env`: Requires `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

## 6. Environment Details

*   **Project Root:** `/Users/macpro/Documents/ai/`
*   **Virtual Environment:** `backend/.venv/`
*   **Telegram Chat ID:** `-4884220020` (for UrbanStep Footwear Ltd.)
