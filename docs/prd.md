Product Requirements Document: Multi-Tenant AI Customer Response System
1. Introduction ‚ú®
This document outlines the requirements for a Multi-Tenant AI Customer Response System. The goal is to provide a scalable and customizable AI solution that enables businesses to automate customer interactions on messaging platforms like Telegram and, eventually, WhatsApp. The system will dynamically adapt its responses based on the specific knowledge base provided by each registered business.

2. Product Goals üéØ
Automate Customer Support: Reduce the manual effort required by businesses to answer repetitive customer inquiries.

Enhance Customer Experience: Provide instant, accurate, and consistent responses to customer questions 24/7.

Multi-Tenant Capability: Allow multiple independent businesses to utilize the same underlying AI system, each with their own isolated knowledge base and branding.

Dynamic Customization: Enable easy registration of new businesses and the seamless input of their unique information, which the AI will then "master."

Cost-Effectiveness: Develop and deploy the system with a $0 budget, relying on open-source technologies and free-tier cloud services.

3. Target Audience üë•
Primary User (You/Admin): The individual or team responsible for registering new businesses and managing their AI knowledge bases within the system.

Secondary Users (Businesses/Clients): Small to medium-sized businesses looking to automate their customer service on messaging platforms without significant upfront investment.

End-Users: Customers of the registered businesses who will interact with the AI system via Telegram and/or WhatsApp.

4. Key Features (Full Vision) üí°
A. Core AI & NLU:

Advanced Conversational AI: Understand natural language queries, intent recognition, and entity extraction.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Dynamically retrieve and synthesize information from a business's specific knowledge base to generate relevant responses.

Context Management: Maintain conversation history to provide coherent multi-turn interactions.

Sentiment Analysis: Detect customer sentiment to escalate urgent or negative interactions to human agents (future).

Multilingual Support: Ability to respond in multiple languages based on user input or business configuration (future).

B. Multi-Tenancy & Data Management:

Secure Tenant Isolation: Ensure each business's data and AI models are completely separate and secure.

Dynamic Knowledge Base Loading: Load and utilize the correct knowledge base based on the incoming message's associated business.

Admin Dashboard:

Business registration and management.

Upload/input business-specific knowledge (FAQs, product details, services, policies).

Performance monitoring and analytics for each business (e.g., number of queries handled, common questions).

User management for businesses (allowing them to manage their own knowledge, future).

C. Messaging Platform Integrations:

Telegram Integration: Full support for Telegram Bot API.

WhatsApp Integration: Full support for WhatsApp Business API (requires addressing cost implications).

Omnichannel Support: Centralized management of conversations across platforms (future).

D. Task Automation:

FAQ Answering: Provide accurate answers to common questions.

Information Lookup: Retrieve specific details (e.g., store hours, contact info, product specifications).

Simple Transactions: Handle basic actions like order status lookup (requires integration with external systems, future).

Lead Qualification: Ask pre-defined questions to qualify leads (future).

Integration with External APIs: Connect to third-party services (e.g., weather, public data, CRM, future).

E. Deployment & Infrastructure:

Scalable and reliable hosting solution.

Monitoring and logging for uptime and performance.

5. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition üöÄ
The MVP focuses on the absolute core functionality to validate the core concept of dynamic, business-specific AI responses on a free platform.

MVP 1: Core Dynamic AI on Telegram
Objective: To demonstrate the ability to register a business, input its knowledge, and have a Telegram AI respond dynamically based on that specific information.

A. Core AI & NLU (Basic RAG):

Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval:

When a message is received, identify the target company_id.

Fetch the knowledge_base text for that company_id from Firestore.

Basic Keyword/Semantic Search: Implement a simple semantic search using Python's sentence-transformers (for embeddings) and scikit-learn/numpy (for similarity search) to find the most relevant paragraph(s) within the fetched knowledge base.

Basic LLM Response Generation: Craft a prompt using the retrieved context and the user's query to generate a concise answer. This will rely on a very small, open-source LLM if self-hosted, or extremely careful token management with a free tier LLM API (if available and sustainable within $0). Given the $0 constraint, this will likely be the most challenging part to make truly "smart" without paid services or significant local hardware.

B. Multi-Tenancy & Data Management:

Company Registration (Manual/Scripted): Initial company registration and knowledge base input will be handled by directly populating Firestore documents or using a simple, local Python script. No dedicated web UI for this yet.

Data Stored per Company: company_id, company_name, knowledge_base (large text field).

Secure Tenant Isolation: Achieved via Firestore Security Rules, ensuring only the bot/admin can access specific company_id knowledge bases.

C. Messaging Platform Integrations:

Telegram Integration (Single Bot Instance): A single Telegram bot token will be used. Users will initiate a conversation by specifying the company_id (e.g., /set_company_id <id>), or the company_id could be linked to the Telegram group/channel the bot is in.

D. Task Automation:

Basic FAQ Answering: The AI will attempt to answer questions directly from the provided knowledge_base text. If an answer isn't found, it will provide a fallback message.

E. Deployment & Infrastructure:

Firestore: Used for company data storage (free tier).

Bot Hosting: Initial deployment and testing on a local machine. If a persistent demo is needed, a Google Cloud f1-micro VM (free tier) will be explored, understanding its severe resource limitations. All Python code (bot logic, NLP libs) will run on this single instance.

MVP 2: Admin UI & Improved Knowledge Management
Objective: Enhance usability for business registration and knowledge input, and incrementally improve AI capabilities. (This would follow a successful MVP 1).

A. Admin Dashboard (Basic Web UI):

Simple Flask/HTML web interface to allow admin (you) to:

Add/Edit company details (name, ID).

Paste/edit knowledge_base text for each company.

B. Improved AI/NLU:

More robust text chunking and embedding generation for RAG.

Potentially more advanced open-source LLM if hosting allows (e.g., a quantized model if self-hosting, or more strategic use of free API tiers).

6. Future Enhancements üìà
WhatsApp Integration: Explore cost-effective solutions for official WhatsApp Business API integration or clear guidance for businesses on manual WhatsApp usage.

Structured Knowledge Input: Allow businesses to upload structured data (e.g., CSV, JSON) or connect to simple web sources.

Performance Analytics: Dashboard showing usage metrics, common queries, and unanswered questions per company.

Human Handoff: Ability to seamlessly transfer a conversation to a human agent when the AI cannot resolve the query.

Pre-built Templates: Offer templates for different business types (e.g., retail, service industry).

User Feedback Mechanism: Allow end-users to rate AI responses for continuous improvement.

Advanced AI Capabilities: More sophisticated conversational flows, proactive outreach, personalized recommendations.

Deployment Automation: Tools for easier deployment and scaling as the system grows.

7. Technical Considerations (Summary) ‚öôÔ∏è
Backend Language: Python

Web Framework (for Admin UI): Flask or FastAPI

Database: Google Cloud Firestore (primary)

NLP/AI: sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, numpy for RAG. Exploration of small open-source LLMs.

Messaging Integration: python-telegram-bot. WhatsApp integration will be a major challenge for $0.

Hosting: Local machine for development, Google Cloud f1-micro VM for limited free deployment.

Version Control: Git/GitHub for code management.

8. Constraints & Assumptions üöß
$0 Budget: This is the primary constraint, guiding all technology choices towards free tiers and open-source solutions. This implies:

Reliance on potentially limited free-tier resources (compute, network, API calls).

Necessity for heavy optimization and efficient coding.

May mean less "cutting-edge" AI performance compared to paid solutions.

WhatsApp automation is highly constrained.

Technical Skill: Assumes proficiency in Python and willingness to learn about NLP, database management, and basic cloud deployment.

Initial Data Input: Assumes manual or basic scripted data entry for company knowledge bases in the MVP.

Performance Expectations: MVP performance will be adequate for demonstrations and low-volume usage, but scalability will be limited by free-tier constraints.

This PRD provides a clear roadmap. The initial focus on MVP 1 will allow us to validate the core concept with minimal resources before building out more advanced features.
