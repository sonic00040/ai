### **Milestone: Phase 2 (Part 1) - Backend Architecture Refactor**

**Date:** August 28, 2025

*   **Task:** Successfully refactored the backend to a multi-tenant, webhook-based architecture.
    *   Updated `config.py` with webhook settings.
    *   Updated `supabase_service.py` with new data access functions.
    *   Re-architected `main.py` to handle multiple bots via webhooks.
    *   Updated `handler.py` to use the new token-based tenant identification.

### **Milestone: Phase 2 (Part 2) - Backend SaaS Logic**

**Date:** August 31, 2025

*   **Task:** Implemented the core SaaS logic for usage metering and limit enforcement.
    *   `rag_service` now counts and returns token usage for each LLM call.
    *   A new `usage_service` was implemented to record usage and check against plan limits.
    *   `handler.py` now fully integrates this logic, enforcing limits before generating a response and recording usage after.
*   **Status:** Completed. The backend is now feature-complete for the MVP.
